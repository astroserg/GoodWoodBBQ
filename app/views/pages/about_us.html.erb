    <h3>Tradition in the Making</h3>

    <p>
      In 1999 two lifetime friends launched the dream and vision of a dinner-house that would revisit the day of owner-operated restaurants. Conceptually the foundations would be – food made fresh from scratch daily, variety and value in a menu centered around the unique style of closed-pit cooking, a team-oriented style of service based on genuineness and sincerely caring, and an environment conducive to family and friends, good conversations and the enjoyment of life. Thus the vision of Goodwood Barbecue Company was born. As you enjoy your experience know that the owner-oriented individuals are involved daily. Taste the freshness of a product and uniqueness that quality ingredients deliver bite after bite. Feel our appreciation of your patronage through service that is timely, caring and efficient. Mostly though, enjoy the moment. Let our efforts lend themselves to what we hope will be a regular occurrence on your part – the establishing of your “tradition in the making”.
